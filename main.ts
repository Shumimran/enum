// Making Enums for Vehicles: Let's create categories for vehicles like cars, trucks,
//  and motorcycles using enums, and show one example.

// Explain & TIP: Enums are like special lists in your code that help you categorize
//  things. They make your code cleaner and easier to understand.

enum vahiclesTypes{

    car,
    Track,
    bus
};

console.log(vahiclesTypes.car);
